# Parallax-Website
Parallax Website A parallax website has backdrop visuals that are fixed and remain in place as you scroll down the page to view different areas of the image. Adjust margin and padding, align text for each section, add background-position, and utilise additional CSS elements and attributes to create a parallax effect.
